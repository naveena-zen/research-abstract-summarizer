# A Transformer-Driven GenAI Platform for Research Abstract Summarization

## Overview
This project presents a transformer-driven Generative AI platform that automatically extracts and summarizes research paper abstracts. Using a state-of-the-art transformer model and an interactive interface, the system enables efficient understanding of academic documents across multiple formats.

## Objectives
- Automatically extract abstract sections from research documents
- Generate concise, human-like summaries using Generative AI
- Support multiple file formats including PDF, TXT, and CSV
- Enable batch processing of multiple research files
- Provide downloadable summarized outputs

## Technologies Used
- Python (Google Colab)
- Transformers (facebook/bart-large-cnn)
- Gradio (User Interface & Login System)
- PyMuPDF (PDF Text Extraction)
- Regular Expressions (Abstract Detection)
- Matplotlib (Visualization)
- Zipfile & OS (File Handling)

## Dataset
This project does not rely on a fixed dataset. Research documents can be uploaded dynamically by users.

### Sample Files Used in This Project
- `CauseOf_Cancer.pdf`
- `immune_system.txt`
- `Neurological_disorders.pdf`
- `Genetic_engg.pdf`

## System Workflow
1. User logs in through the Gradio interface
2. Research documents are uploaded (PDF/TXT/CSV)
3. Abstract sections are extracted using pattern matching
4. Summaries are generated using a transformer-based GenAI model
5. Results are saved and bundled into a downloadable ZIP file

## Supported File Formats
- PDF
- TXT
- CSV

## Key Features
- Transformer-based Generative AI summarization
- Intelligent abstract extraction
- Multi-file upload and batch processing
- Downloadable summary files
- Clean and interactive user interface

## Applications
- Academic research and literature reviews
- Student project analysis
- Research assistance tools
- Large-scale document summarization

## Conclusion
This platform demonstrates the effective use of transformer-driven Generative AI for automating research abstract extraction and summarization. It improves research productivity by reducing manual effort and enabling faster comprehension of scholarly documents.
